## future ideias
* Change the Animation.load to also load a hitbox specific to an animation, sprite, or even individual frames
maybe even with the option to have multiple hitboxes then integrate this with aseprite or something like that


## features thta need to implement ( priority from top to bottom)
* Tilemap class for loading maps
* Cool ui like actual ui textinputs and shit
* Debug class like flixel debug

## things to fix
